Breast Cancer has become a common problem with women and it is detected at a late stage. Early Detection of breast cancer can be detected wether it is benign or malign with the help of machine learning. With concept of SVM(Support Vector Machine) this can be made possible. Support-Vector Machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. So with help of SVM we can classify wether the cancer is benign or malign and it can be diagnosed early. With the help of AI we can save a lot of lives. The data set is got from sckit learn
